    <h1>Presentation</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am VIDAL Antoine. After obtaining a High School Diploma at the Lycée Hoche, I headed towards the Engineering Degree at the <a href="https://www.isty.uvsq.fr/cycle-ingenieur-informatique">ISTY</a>. I'd like to become Back-End developer (or Full-Stack if possible).</p>

    <h1>Computer engineering skills</h1>

    <p>Computers and programming is a field I have interest in. Given their omnipresence nowadays, it is hard to do without. That's why I would like to make my career in this field.</p>
    <p>During my course at the <a href="https://www.isty.uvsq.fr/">ISTY</a>, I familiarized with the well-known programming languages : C, Python,... Nevertheless I always want to broaden my knowledge and thus discovering new languages doesn't repel me.</p>
    <p>If you would like to know more about me you can look at my resume <a href="docs/CV_Antoine_VIDAL_2022.pdf" target=”_blank”>CV</a> (although it is in French) or my <a href="https://github.com/VIDAL-Antoine" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>Apart from computer engineering, I am very interested in the japanese culture. Their mindset and way of thinking is very enriching for a westerner. I haven't reached perfect fluency in Japanese right now but I'd like to pass JLPT N3 (equivalent of the B1 level from the CEFRL, JLPT being an equivalent of the TOEIC).</p>
    <p>You can find various documents regarding my knowledge of the Japanese language which are from the <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> software. The first file represents all the vocabulary learned up to now, and is from this <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2112246396">deck</a>. The other files are web pages which only represent the kanjis that I am familiar with : there is the ordering according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8Diku_kanji">elementary japanese school</a> (教育漢字) and according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test">JLPT</a>.</p>
